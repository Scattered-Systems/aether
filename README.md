# Aether

Aether was created to support the future of internet based experiences by ensuring the digital security of all interactions on the network. Globally, Aether will be deployed as an Ethereum native multi-chain with a focus on security and speed. One of the optimization being developed is the advent of user-centric _microchains_ or a constant size, zk-SNARK blockchain which operates as their personal cloud computing platform as well as their key to public spaces.
